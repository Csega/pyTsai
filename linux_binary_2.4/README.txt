NOTE: This is compiled for python 2.4 on Ubuntu 5.10 so your mileage may vary.
To install put

Tsai.pyc
Tsai.py
Tsai.pyd

into

/<Python24 install dir>/site-packages

****** ALSO NOTE ****** that this seems to also run fine without a full python install! if you put 

Tsai.pyc
Tsai.py
Tsai.pyd

into the blender scripts directory.

Dont forget you still need to load
BlenderTsai.py
from the original distribution into blender and run.
