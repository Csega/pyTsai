To build on windows for Python 2.4
I followed the instructions here
http://www.vrplumber.com/programming/mstoolkit/

I have included:
The patch from the web page above
An allready patched version of msvccompiler.py to save you patching it :)
The vc7.bat from the webpage above renamed to vc7_setvars.bat and paths modified for my system :)
A copy of the web page above lest it dissapears "Building Python Extensions with the MS Toolkit Compiler.htm"

Once you have done all that you simply follow the instructions in the doc folder as on linux.
