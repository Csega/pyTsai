NOTE: Use the version that matches your python install (2.4 or 2.5 or 2.6)
To install put

Tsai.pyc
Tsai.py
Tsai.pyd

into

C:\<PythonXX install dir>\Lib\site-packages

****** ALSO NOTE ****** that this seems to also run fine without a full python install! if you put 

Tsai.py
Tsai.pyd

into the blender scripts directory.

Dont forget you still need to load
BlenderTsai.py
from the original distribution into blender and run.
